# Black Eye

Utilizes `IOKit` to keep your Mac awake.

## Notes

At the moment SwiftUI does not natively support right-click, I could look into [MenuBarExtraAccess](https://github.com/orchetect/MenuBarExtraAccess) or wait for WWDC and maybe we get something as simple as a right-click?

## Tasks

- [ ] Enable notifications.
- [ ] Waiting: Move menu to right-click and have left-click directly toggle.
